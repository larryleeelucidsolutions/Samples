Google Scholar Search Module Readme
===================================

The Google Scholar Search module defines an API that can be used to
search Google Scholar for citations.

Google Scholar does not provide an API and so this module uses the HTML
web interface to search Google Scholar.

This module defines the following components:

  * Drush Commands
    * google-scholar-search
      Searches Google Scholar for articles containing the given search terms.
