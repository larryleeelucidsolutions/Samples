Source Code Samples
===================

This folder contains a collection of source code samples. I've included five projects that I hope demonstrate my coding style and abilities.


Lucidity Demo
-------------

https://github.com/ElucidSolutions/lucidity-demo

The first of these is the source code for the Lucidity Demo project which contains a simple website created using Lucidity. This project does not have any backend dependencies and can be viewed locally using Firefox or any other browser that allows you to load files locally. The modules for this project were developed using Literate Programming style and are best viewed on GitHub.

Highlights:

* Literate Programming
* Single-page Architecture
* Detailed Documentation
* Extensive Unittest Coverage
* Video Library and Search Features

MHealth Database
----------------

This project includes a collection of modules from the mHealth Evidence project which was a Drupal 7 website serving peer-reviewed research about mobile health interventions. I've included this project to demonstrate my coding style, familiarity with Drupal's module system, and ability to interface with remote data sources. Several of these modules were also used on the Popline project.

Highlights:

* Extensive Documentation
* Unittest Coverage
* Remote API Integration

Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)
------------------------------------------------

https://achp.gov

This project includes a selection of modules from the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation site. The modules included: Section 106 Map, Slide Format, and View Term List; demonstrate my familiarity with Drupal 8's module system. I was the lead developer for this site in 2017 while working for Elucid Solutions. Our development team consisted of me and one other junior developer who I mentored while delivering the site  

Highlights

* Extensive Documentation
* Drupal 8 Module Development
* Well Structured JS

Gist
----

https://github.com/llee454/Gist

Gist is a personal project that I created to parse RSS newsfeed summaries to produce semantic summaries in RDF. Written in Curry, the program uses context free grammars to parse short texts.

Highlights:

* Interesting Algorithm (Non-deterministic Context Free Grammar Parsing)

Kakuro
------

https://github.com/llee454/Kakuro

Kakuro is another personal project that I created. This project was created to solve Kakuro puzzles. The program is written in an imperative programming language (D version 1).

Highlights:

* Interesting Algorithm (Classic AI Search)
* Imperative Programming Language (D)
